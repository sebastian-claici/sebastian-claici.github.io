I am a Software Engineer at Google NY working on large scale machine learning to make the web a better place.

Before that I was a PhD student at the Geometric Data Processing Group at MIT. My research focus was on discrete optimal transport with applications to Bayesian inference, robust learning, clustering, and data summarisation. During my time in GDP I’ve been lucky to collaborate with many incredible people, among them Justin Solomon, Edward Chien, Matthew Staib, and Hugo Lavenant.

Prior to joining Justin’s group, I was a Master’s student with Daniela Rus in the Distributed Robotics Lab where I worked on modular robotics and path planning. Before coming to MIT, I received my BSc from the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom under the supervision of Klaus-Peter Zauner.

I have done internships in interpretability of deep learning at Google, semantic segmentation with Bosch Research and Technology Center, and user experience at EPFL in Lausanne.
